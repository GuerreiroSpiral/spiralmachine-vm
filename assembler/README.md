# Spiral Assembler
This is an assembler for the Spiral Machine theoretical VM. I developed this Assembler in the Python language due to the string manipulation capabilities of it.
Currently, it lacks any type of user input capabilities.

## Warning
Values should be defined as hex with four elements. **Example:**
=> LDI 0x0002, 0x0003 # Correct!
=> LDI 0x02, 0x03 # Incorrect, please don't use it like this.
